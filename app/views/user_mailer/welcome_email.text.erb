Hey <%= @name.capitalize %>,
\n
We're super excited that you applied! This is just a confirmation email
that we've received your application.\n\n

We send out our admissions decisions in waves each week, but if you don't
hear anything during the next one, don't worry! Your application is still
under consideration; it just means this wave filled up before we got you.\n

Take care,\n
